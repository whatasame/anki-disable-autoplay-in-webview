# Disable autoplay in webview

This [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) addon allows you to disable autoplay for HTML tag in the editor and browser.

## When to use this addon?

When editing a card, if a video or audio tag has the autoplay attribute, it can be quite annoying when it plays
automaticallyâ€”especially if it overlaps with previous media while you're repeatedly editing the tag.

To prevent this, we need to ensure that media in the webview, including both the editor and browser, does not play
automatically.

This addon helps disable autoplay in the webview.

## Getting started

Install the addon from [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/525094096)
or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/whatasame/anki-disable-autoplay-in-webview/releases) locally.

By default, autoplay is disabled. If you want to enable autoplay again or specific webview, you can do so in the addon
settings.

Go to **Tools > Disable autoplay in webview**
